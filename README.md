notice:
**"I faced a challenge in designing the database structure to represent an invoice containing multiple items. I made two mistakes before finding the correct solution. Initially, 
I created a separate table for individual invoices and used a foreign key in this table for reference to the Multi-invoice ID. However, this approach was incorrect.The correct solution 
was to have one table with two foreign keys: one referencing the invoice and the other referencing the product Otherwise, I needed another table for invoices with multiple items
(composite invoices) and a separate table for single-item invoices."**

--I regret the mistakes I made during this process, but as I am still a junior developer, I see these challenges as valuable learning experiences."**
